# Terraform Best Practices

## 1. Secure Storage of Secrets
- Use environment variables to store sensitive data (e.g., GitHub token).
- Avoid hardcoding secrets directly into the configuration files.

## 2. Importing Existing Resources
- If a resource already exists in your infrastructure, use the `terraform import` command to include it in your Terraform configuration.

## 3. Modular Structure
- Organize your Terraform code into reusable modules to improve maintainability and scalability.
- Break down complex configurations into smaller, manageable components.

## 4. Branch Protection
- Configure branch protection rules for critical branches (e.g., `main`) to enforce code reviews, status checks, and other safeguards.
- Ensure that pull request reviews and required approvals are enforced before merging changes.
